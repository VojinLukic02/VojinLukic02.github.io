The files were extracted from CATIA V5, which is an exclusive software which requires licence, and therefore I could only work on the companies computers. 
The only way to extract and save the files is in this file format, and it will be difficult to visualize them unless the viewer owns CATIA V5 and can successfuly
unpack them.
